There are standard lengths of construction materials available in the market. For example, any size of angle bar, square pipe, round pipe is 5.7m long. Different sizes of these materials are required in structures. The code calculates the number of lengths required and the offcuts for a stucture. Offcuts are left-overs. 

A structure may require, for example, pieces of 9.6m, 2.0m, 3.45m of angle bar.

The code takes parameters like this: 
lengths(pieces, market_standard) e.g lengths([9.6, 2.0, 3.45], 5.7)
Returns number of standard length
